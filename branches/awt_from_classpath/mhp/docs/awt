This AWT is based on Kaffe's old AWT and adapted to the needs of MHP.

The following classes contain changes to the original implementation:
AWTEvent
Color
Component
Container
Defaults
EventDispatchThread
EventQueue
FocusEvt
Font
FontMetrics
Image
ImageNativeProducer
Toolkit

All classes beginning with MHP* have been added.
Several classes have been removed because they are not needed
for MHP (most notably Window and Frame)

In the future an implementation as a peer of the classpath
AWT may be possible, this needs to be evaluated.
