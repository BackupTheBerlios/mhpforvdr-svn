Note that currently the core classes
   DSMCCStream
   DSMCCStreamEvent
   ServiceDomain
and the classes
   NPTDiscontinuityEvent
   NPTListener
   NPTPresentEvent
   NPTRate
   NPTRateChangeEvent
   NPTRemovedEvent
   NPTStatusEvent
   ServiceXFRReference
   ServiceXFRException
   ServiceXFRErrorEvent
   StreamEvent
   StreamEventListener
are not implemented.

Moreover, the current (partial) implementation does not use the concept 
"read the stream and know what happens in it" but rather something like
"let libdsmcc write its stuff to disk and see what we can offer my callers from the files".
