Description:

This plugin aims at an implementation of the 
Multimedia Home Platform (MHP) for VDR.


STATUS of this file:
   Updated 2 July 2005 for compilation from SVN


Installation:
 
 The plugin requires five steps. Please do not forget step 2, 4 and 5, which
 are unusual for VDR plugins.

 1)The plugin has quite a few dependencies. Please check this list
   before compiling the plugin.
   You need:
   
   - VDR 1.3.x series, tested with version 1.3.23, later versions are okay,
     earlier versions are not recommended/may not work (it is a development series after all)
     
   - A Java virtual machine based on GNU Classpath. 'Currently, the only supported VM is
   
     - SableVM, current SVN snapshot.
         Get the latest version from SVN, the 1.11 release of SableVM does not work:
         
         svn co svn://svn.sablevm.org/sablevm/trunk sablevm-trunk
         svn co svn://svn.sablevm.org/sablevm-classpath/trunk sablevm-classpath-trunk
         
         Some dependencies (Jikes, libpopt) are already included in this package.
         
         Compile and install SableVM.
         If you don't have GTK installed, you can savely disable
         compilation of the GTK peer of Classpath, it is not needed.
         
   - DirectFB (www.directfb.org), version 0.9.20, 0.9.21 or 0.9.22.
      Please note that DirectFB is primarily used for its graphics capabilities.
      You do _not_ need a working framebuffer or supported graphics card.
      Do
      
      ./configure; make; make install      
      
       (Or, if you install DirectFB only for this plugins and have no plans to use
        it with your graphics card (e.g. for the softdevice output method),
        you can switch off compiling the graphics driver parts:
      
        ./configure --with-gfxdrivers= --disable-fbdev
      
        If you do not know which one to choose, ignore this hint and choose the first suggestion.)
      
      In the output from configure, please check for PNG, JPG and Freetype support.
      If there is a "no", please check this:
         - libpng >= 1.2.0
         - libjpeg >= 6.2
         - freetype2 >= 2.0.2 
         
   - DFB++, with the same version number as your DirectFB installation
   
     This needs
       * pkg-config (http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/, but
         this is a standard package, it will be available from your distributor)
        
     If you installed DirectFB (as recommended) in /usr/local, and DFB++' configure
     complains, do
     PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/ ./configure
      
   - ffmpeg, both 0.4.8 and 0.4.9-pre1 are tested
     ./configure --enable-shared

   - The MPEG encoding for the traditional FF-card output will require some power
     from your CPU, but it is not real time encoding, only one picture per change.
     I tested on a a 1,2 GHz Celeron processor which is  more than sufficient,
     so I expect really low power CPUs to work. Expensive drawing operations,
     such as displaying 3.2 megapixel Jpegs on TV, are a different story.

   Please compile and install all these packages.
   
 2)Edit Make.config and adapt the paths to your system.

 3)Now it is time to compile the plugin like all other plugins.
 
 4)Some files (Java and native libraries from the MHP stack, fonts)
   need to be installed to /usr/local/vdr/mhp.
   Descend into the plugin's main directory and execute (as root)
   
   "make install".
   
 5)Command line arguments:
   The plugin needs to know the VDR plugin directory.
   So if you start VDR with the "-L" option, start the plugin with the same option:
   "-P 'mhp -L /path/to/PLUGINS/lib'"
   If you don't do this, it won't work and you will reminded by an error message in the syslog.
   
   Now enjoy...



Additional information for developers can be found in 
the README.DEVELOPER file.
If you only want to use the plugin, you do NOT need to read this.
