DFB++


This is a C++ binding for DirectFB providing a much easier usage.

One advantage is that the 'thiz' doesn't need to be passed
as the first argument of every interface function, e.g.

	dfb->SetVideoMode (dfb, 640, 480, 16);

As C++ provides "this" you simply call:

	dfb->SetVideoMode (640, 480, 16);


Another feature is the usage of exceptions. It's annoying having
these error checking stuff with growing deinitialization stacks.
Most functions are 'void'. As soon as a DirectFB function returns
an error a DFBException is thrown. This also means that all functions
that return only one argument return it directly. Another example:

	IDirectFB             *dfb;
	DFBResult              ret;
	DFBSurfaceDescription  dsc;

	[... set dsc ...]

	ret = dfb->CreateSurface (dfb, &dsc, &surface);
	if (ret) {
		DirectFBError ("IDirectFB::CreateSurface", ret);
		[...deinit stuff...]
		return;
	}

The DFB++ version:

	IDirectFB *dfb;

	try {
		DFBSurfaceDescription dsc;

		[... set dsc ...]

		surface = dfb->CreateSurface (dsc);
	}
	catch (DFBException *ex) {
		cerr << "Caught exception: " << ex << endl;
		[...deinit stuff...]
	}


You may also notice that some arguments (e.g. 'dsc')
that have been pointers are references now where applicable.

The DFBException has some useful functions like 'GetAction()' and
'GetResult()' both returning a string. The example above uses
the "<<" operator which produces output like this:

	Caught exception: DirectFB::Create() -> General initialization failure!


Please have a look at the example(s) within the distribution
for a more sophisticated demonstration.
